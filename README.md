```

## Running driftkit

### Starting the program
If your default python version is version 3.x, run the following in your terminal
```
$ python driftkit.py            # If you have python3 installed and it is default
$ python3 driftkit.py           # If you have python3 installed and it is not default
```

To check your default python version, run the following command
```
$ python --version

Checking for update...
Data already up to date
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Would you like to use the terminal or the webserver interface?
> 
```
Enter ```terminal``` (webserver interface is not yet functional)

```
Current Latitude >
Current Longitude >
```
Enter your latitude and longitude (you can get this information in Google Maps) as precisely as you can to ensure accuracy (a missing digit can throw off the distance calculations by a very large margin)

```
Enter max distance to display cameras from (0 for no limit) >
```
If you want to show cameras within a certain distance from you, enter that distance (in kilometres). Otherwise, enter ```0```

The program will print the camera data

```
Options: refresh, lite, quit
>
```
Enter one of the three options

```refresh``` will ask you for your new coordinates and max distance and update the distances accordingly

```lite``` will re-run the program with a condensed output

```quit``` will exit the program
